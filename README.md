# Notes-on-Physics-Mathematics
Notes I've taken over the years, unfortunately, a lot is still in progress.
I will be cleaning up a lot of these in the coming months, when I'm less busy.
When I get the chance to clean up the notes, I will include the TeX files, as 
well as some fun code in C++ - hopefully.

Update: Classical mechanics is finished. Working on methods and relativity now.
